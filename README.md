# Hey, what's up? 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Jonathan Ronald, currently a student at **Asia-Pacific International University** 🎓, majoring in **Information Technology**. Here’s a little about me:

- 🎶 **Rhythm Seeker**: I enjoy not just listening to music but also making it—there’s something magical about hitting the right notes!
- 🌐 **Language Enthusiast**: Always excited to learn new languages, whether programming languages or spoken ones!
- 💻 **Code Learner**: I’m not quite a programming guru… yet. My code doesn’t always run, but when it does, I’m just as surprised as you are!
